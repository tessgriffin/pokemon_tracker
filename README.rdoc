=== Track Pokemon

Welcome to my personal project for the Turing School of Software Design called Track Pokemon.

You can find it at https://track-pokemon.herokuapp.com/

This project incorporates Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, JQuery, and AngularJS. I also consume the pokemon API at http://pokeapi.co/
